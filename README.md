# Opencv-projects


# Title

My projects in master degree semester 1Ôºå including my learning and debugging processes. 


## Installation
- All the `code` required to get started

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/LiuSirui99/Opencv-projects.git`

### Setup
- **For MacOS:**

    I am using MacOS Catalina version 10.15.6.

    For setting up the opencv-python running env I am using pycharm as the editor. 
    Just go to the terminal with the command: 
    
    $ pip3 install opencv-python
   
    In case of opencv in c++, git clone one of my xcode projects and then modify the path 
    of include hearder and library as it installed in your machine.

- **For Ubuntu:**

    **Installation**.
    Install the opencv release from official website: <a href="https://opencv.org/releases/" target="_blank">`https://opencv.org/releases/`</a>.

    Extract the directory and apply
    ```
    $ cd ~/opencv
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    ```

    **Configuring**. 
    Run cmake [<some optional parameters>] <path to the OpenCV source directory>

    For example
    ```
    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    ```

    build type: `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\Debug`
    to build with modules from opencv_contrib set OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH to <path to opencv_contrib/modules/>
    set BUILD_DOCS for building documents
    set BUILD_EXAMPLES to build all examples

    **Build**. 
    From build directory execute make, it is recommended to do this in several threads

    For example
    ```
    $ make -j7 # runs 7 jobs in parallel
    ```

    **Library**.
    To install libraries, execute the following command from build directory
    ```
    $ sudo make install
    ```
    **Install the dependencies**: 
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libvtk5-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libopenexr-dev libtbb-dev
    $ [compiler] sudo apt-get install build-essential
    $ [required] sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
    ```

    **Testing**.
    For testing your settings, clone the repo <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra" target="_blank">`https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra`</a>.

    set OPENCV_TEST_DATA_PATH environment variable to <path to opencv_extra/testdata>.
    execute tests from build directory.

    For example
    ```
    $ <cmake_build_dir>/bin/opencv_test_core
    ```


### Testing
For testing your settings, clone the Translation.py in testopencv folder, choose your image and press run. You should see an new window which displays the result of translation of your image.
